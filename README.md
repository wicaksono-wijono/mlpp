# Project for Machine Learning with Probabilistic Programming

The Kalman Filter is the optimal time series predictor given Gaussian errors with known variances. However, in virtually all real-world scenarios, the variances are unknown. We come up with an algorithm to estimate the covariance matrices as we make predictions.

As a disclaimer, I don't think it is a good algorithm--I suspect it does not converge to the correct covariance matrices. Nonetheless, it was a great learning experience to figure out how to fit the model. The primary goal is not to make the best predictions but to train the specified probabilistic model.
